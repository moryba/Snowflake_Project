# Snowflake_Project (Nanodegree Data Architect - Udacity)

In this project scenario, I will use actual YELP and climate datasets in order to analyze the effects the weather has on customer reviews of restaurants. The data for temperature and precipitation observations are from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) database. I will use a leading industry cloud-native data warehouse system called Snowflake for all aspects of the project.

I will then apply the skills they have acquired in the preceding Designing Data Systems Course to architect and design a Data Warehouse DWH for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP).
